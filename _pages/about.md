I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning theory advised by [Prof. Debarghya Ghoshdastidar](https://www.in.tum.de/tfai/people/debarghya-ghoshdastidar/) at the [Theoretical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.in.tum.de/tfai/home/) group, Technical University of Munich since August 2021.
My research focuses on the theory of deep learning primarily in understanding the connection of deep networks to kernel machines and in studying its adversarial robustness.
I am also interested in graph based learning and statistical learning theory.

Previously, I did Masters of Science in Informatics at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/informatics/) and bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from [National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India](https://www.nitt.edu/).
Between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I spent a little over 3 years at [Adobe Systems, India](https://www.adobe.com/) as a Computer Scientist.

**Research Interests**
* Theory of deep learning
* Machine learning on graphs
* Statistical learning theory
